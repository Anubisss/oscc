                      OSCC - Opcode Switch Case Calculator
===============================================================================



OSCC is a simple calculator written in C# and developped with
Visual Studio 11 (2012). This tool can calculate "switch case" values
from opcodes and vica versa. With switch case values you can find the
proper handlers for each packet in WoW.
